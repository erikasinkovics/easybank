## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This project is based on a coding challenge by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). Frontend Mentor offers real-world HTML, CSS and JavaScript projects accompagnied b professional designs.

The packages provided by FM contain the following:
- Assets required optimized for mobile and desktop layouts.
- A `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information needed, such as color palette and fonts.
- Mobile and desktop designs in inside the `/design` folder.
- 'raw' HTML file with pre-written content.

## Objective

My aim with taking this challenge was to keep my HTML and CSS skills fresh and try my hand at a real-life workflow with a responsive layout.

Key aspects of the project:
- responsive design,
- interactive elements,
- event handling in JavaScript.

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the provided design as possible.

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
